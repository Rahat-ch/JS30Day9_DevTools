# JS30Day9_DevTools

Nothing fancy today but a very valuable lesson and different tools the console has! I especially found it useful that the console can throw custom error messages. This could help in certain complex bits of code to throw an error when something isn't working out. Count and timing I could also see having great uses for future projects! 

As always deployed project is below:
